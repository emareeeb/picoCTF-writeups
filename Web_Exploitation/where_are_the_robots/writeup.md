# Unraveling the Robo Riddle 🤖

## Scenario

Upon clicking a mysterious link, a blank site greets you with a bold proclamation: 

### “Welcome, Where are the robots?”

## Cyber Sleuth Instincts 🕵️‍♂️

The word “robots” triggers thoughts of robots.txt files, a common beacon in the world of CTFs. These files guide search engine crawlers on permissible URLs. The hint drops a subtle clue: "What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn’t want you to look?"

## Investigative Steps

1. **Explore Robots Territory**
   - Access the robots.txt file by adding `/robots.txt` to the site's URL.

2. **Decoding the Directive**
   - Dive into the file's "Disallow" section, which, being an HTML extension, hints at a hidden webpage.

3. **Following the Trail**
   - Add `/8028f.html` to the site’s URL, unleashing the secret within.

4. **Ta-da Moment**
   - Voila! The flag emerges triumphantly: `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}`
