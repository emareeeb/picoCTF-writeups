## Solution

### Step 1: Enter the Mysterious Realm 🕵️‍♂️

First things first, we need to log in as Joe. Rumor has it, Joe has the inside scoop on what the factory's been up to.

### Step 2: Attempt to Uncover the Secrets 🤨

Strangely enough, no matter what credentials we use, the login seems to work just fine. However, the elusive flag remains elusive. What's going on here? Time to put on our detective hats!

### Step 3: The Cookie Conundrum 🍪

Our investigation leads us to the browser's cookie section. Lo and behold, there's a cookie called `admin` set to `False`. Aha! This little rascal might be the key to unlocking the hidden treasures.

### Step 4: Flip the Cookie Switch 🔄

With a sly grin, we change the value of the `admin` cookie from `False` to `True`. It's like giving the factory a VIP pass to our detective party.

### Step 5: Refresh and Rejoice 🎉

With the cookie magic in place, we hit that refresh button, and voila! The factory spills the beans, and there it is—the glorious flag, waving at us like a victory banner.

And there you have it! We've outsmarted the factory and unlocked the secrets that were hidden from plain sight. Remember, in the world of challenges, a little bit of cookie manipulation goes a long way.

Happy hacking, and may your cookies always be sweet and full of flags! 🍪🕵️‍♂️
