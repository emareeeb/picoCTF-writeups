**🛠️ Solution** 🛠️
  
To conquer this challenge, fire up Burp Suite and embrace its request-modifying abilities. 
As you inspect the webpage, you'll notice the HTTP methods used for "Red" and "Blue": "GET" and "POST," respectively. Let's dig deeper into these divergent HTTP requests.

Aha! The mystery unfolds as you examine the list of methods, and "HEAD" grabs your attention. Recall the challenge's playful title, "Get aHead" - a subtle nod to the "HEAD" HTTP request method.

Now by experimenting with the "Turn Blue" and "Turn Red" options on the webpage and inspecting the responses in Burp Suite, I right-clicked and used the "Send it to Repeater" feature. Recalling the challenge title, "Get aHead," I realized that HTTP also has a method called "HEAD". So, I replaced the current "POST" method with "HEAD" in the URL, and there it was, the flag! 🚩😎
